# Gnasher API

Gnasher API is a comprehensive backend system designed for villa booking and B&B bookings processes. It is built on Node.js and interacts with a MySQL database, providing a JSON API for various operations. The system is primarily focused on user management, project tracking, and integration with external data sources like Google Sheets.

## Features

- **Booking Management**: Create, read, update, and delete bookings information. Includes ability for maintenance and owner bookings
- **Calendar Management**: Manages the calendar of villas to profile a single point of calendaring
- **Data Import**: Import data from Google Sheets into the Snowy database, facilitating seamless integration of external data sources.
- **Authentication**: Secure routes with JWT-based authentication middleware.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling for consistent API responses.
- **API Documentation**: Interactive API documentation using Swagger.

## Technologies

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js, used for routing and middleware.
- **Sequelize**: Promise-based ORM for Node.js, used for database operations.
- **MySQL**: Database system used for data storage.
- **Swagger**: API documentation and exploration tool.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication.
- **Bcryptjs**: Library for hashing and comparing passwords.
- **Nodemailer**: (Not visible installed yet) for sending emails, like password reset emails.
