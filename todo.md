# Snowy API - Authentication Implementation To-Do List

## Overview
The Snowy API requires a robust authentication system to manage user access for various functionalities like registration, login, and password reset. The system should also ensure that certain routes are protected and accessible only to authenticated users.

## To-Do List

### 1. Authentication Controller
- [ ] **Implement Email Sending for Password Reset**
    - Implement the functionality to send a password reset email in `authController.requestPasswordReset`.
    - Use a library like nodemailer to send emails.
    - Ensure the email contains the reset token and instructions for resetting the password.

- [ ] **Complete Password Reset Logic**
    - Finalize the `authController.resetPassword` method.
    - Ensure the reset token is validated, and the password is reset securely.

### 2. User Model Adjustments
- [x] **Add Reset Token Fields**
    - Add `resetToken` and `resetTokenExpires` fields to the User model.
    - Ensure these fields are used appropriately during the password reset process.

### 3. Route Protection
- [ ] **Implement Middleware for Route Protection**
    - Develop or finalize `middleware/authentication.js` to protect routes.
    - Ensure the middleware checks for valid JWT tokens in the request headers.

- [ ] **Secure Routes**
    - Apply the authentication middleware to routes that require user authentication.
    - Test protected routes for proper access control.

### 4. Testing
- [ ] **Unit Tests for Authentication Features**
    - Write unit tests for registration, login, password reset, and route protection.
    - Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.

- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**
    - Perform end-to-end testing to ensure the authentication flow works as expected.
    - Test password reset flow from email receipt to password update.

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] **Update API Documentation**
    - Document the new endpoints (`/register`, `/login`, `/reset`, etc.) in Swagger.
    - Ensure the documentation includes request/response formats and error codes.

- [ ] **Readme Update**
    - Update the `README.md` file to include information about the authentication features.
    - Provide setup instructions and environment variable details (e.g., JWT_SECRET, email configurations).

### 6. Security Checks
- [ ] **Review and Test for Security Vulnerabilities**
    - Ensure password hashing and comparison are securely implemented.
    - Check for JWT token security and proper handling of sensitive information.

- [ ] **Rate Limiting and Monitoring**
    - Implement rate limiting on authentication routes to prevent brute force attacks.
    - Set up monitoring for failed login attempts and suspicious activities.

### 7. Deployment and Environment Configuration
- [ ] **Environment Variables Setup**
    - Set up necessary environment variables in the deployment environment (e.g., JWT_SECRET, email credentials).

- [ ] **Deployment Testing**
    - Test the authentication system in the staging/production environment to ensure everything works as expected.

### 8. Additional Features (Optional)
- [ ] **OAuth Integration**
    - Consider implementing OAuth integration for third-party logins (e.g., Google, Facebook).

- [ ] **Two-Factor Authentication**
    - Explore and possibly implement two-factor authentication for additional security.
