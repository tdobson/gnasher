are users/teams decoupled? What if one is off sick?
can they send to subcontract company directly?
properly figure out how to do multi elevations

product_pricing? How do we deal with pricing that changes? Pricing for the date
in a multi elevation, there can me multiple strings of panels, but often 1 inverter, the orientation and direction and pitch etc will be different for each string of panels - each elevantion will need to report on total yield and things per array, but also for the entire installation.
gen meter is per installation

for each Plot:
- what was the plot specc'd as?
- what did the plot come back with?

when building a quote, you want your prices to be fixed at th emoment you *send* the quote, but you still want to monitor the current prices against the quote.


Each Plot will have a
plot_quoted
table with
